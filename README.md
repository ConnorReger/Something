### Something
# Program Function:
Our program asks the user if they want a string reversed. If the answer is yes, the program will prompt for a name and a word. It will then reverse it and print it out for the user to see.
    
We chose the MIT license because we are not looking to profit off of the program and this way students could access and edit the program easily for academic purposes. (found at https://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/)
